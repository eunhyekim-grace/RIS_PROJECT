# RIS_PROJECT - Object Detection

Duckietown was initially introduced by MIT and later adopted by many other universities who saw its potential and outreach effort. A cheap platform, in comparison to a car, for which one can teach an advanced autonomy class anywhere. In our efforts to bring another contribution to this class, my partner and I focused on the concept of object detection. Where we used architectures such as YOLOv4 and ROS together to make this happen.


## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Tensorflow
* ROS Noetic
* Ubuntu 20.04.4 (focal)
* YOLO v4

### Executing program
* Set up and calibrate the duckiebot using the following [guide](https://docs.duckietown.org/daffy/opmanual_duckiebot/out/index.html)
* Take a look at the ROS Wiki website to create a [workspace](https://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/CreatingPackage)
* Edit the .bashrc to change the name of your rosmaster and connect to your bot by adding this line at the end
```
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://[name of your bot].local:11311
```
* Download the repository
```
cd catkin_workspace/src
```
```
git clone --recursive git@github.com:leggedrobotics/darknet_ros.git
```
