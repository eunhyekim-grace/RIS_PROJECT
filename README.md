# RIS_PROJECT - Object Detection

Duckietown was initially introduced by MIT and later adopted by many other universities who saw its potential and outreach effort. A cheap platform, in comparison to a car, for which one can teach an advanced autonomy class anywhere. In our efforts to bring another contribution to this class, my partner and I focused on the concept of object detection. Where we used architectures such as YOLOv4 and ROS together to make this happen.
